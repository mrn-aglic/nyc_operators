# From Data Pipelines with Airflow book

This is a Github repo for the package from chapter 14 of 
the book Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow from Manning.

The repo with all of the chapters is [here](https://github.com/mrn-aglic/datapipelines-airflow-book).

This is the second Github repo I created dedicated for packages.
The other one is related to chapters 08 and 09 and can be found [here](https://github.com/mrn-aglic/airflow_book_example_package_repo/tree/734a098291620fee16296a0183be6b18cca5060b).
